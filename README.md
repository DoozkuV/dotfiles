# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles - very much a work in progress! 

Includes configuration for neovim, alacritty, and tmux,
as well as a custom script I wrote called "mark" which interacts with rofi
to quickly open common directories. 

Note that the alacritty themes won't work until you install the alacritty-theme repo!
